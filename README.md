# 🚀 InstaBot

InstaBot is a tool designed for sending direct messages to your Instagram followers or those you follow. However, there are a few important things to keep in mind. Do not use this bot to send messages to a large number of people or spam others, as it may result in your account being banned. You can add multiple Instagram accounts in the account.json file. 

## Installation
